# FlowerClassfication
The goal of the project is to design and build a system which automatically classifies an image of
a flower for hundreds of flower species. The classification should be done with reasonable amount of
time so that it is usable for a real-time computer vision application.Classification of flower 102 data-set
is a challenging task due to variation in orientation, projection angle, number of depicted flowers along
with different resolution, contrast, sharpness and white-balancing. For this classification task we propose
Dense Convolution Network(DenseNet) architecture to distinguish flowers of a wide range of species.
